# binary-search-in-neural-nets
Drexel AI's Fall Term research project on efficiently searching for accurate neural net architectures

Deadline: December 12, 2020

-[] Pick a Dataset that can be generalized \
-[] Implement linear search (O(N)) # need to train the model N times. \
-[] Implement binary search (O(log(N))) # need to train the model N times.
-[] Determine trendline over two end points, determine the slope and determine side to get rid of \
-[] Find the maximum value in a partially sorted array \
-[] Adapt the code so that user can pass n as input and run the entire pipeline (train + test + save) \
-[] Plot the loss and accuracy given a neural net for our problem
